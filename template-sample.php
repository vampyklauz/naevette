				Unified communication is about bringing your business together, no matter their location. Providing clear video conferencing, screen sharing, incorporating mobile devices into your network, these are just a few of the things you can accomplish. A higher level of service than VOIP, unified communications provides larger companies with the communications efficiency of a smaller business.

				Naevette is experienced at implementing the “big two” of unified communication: Cisco Jabber and Microsoft Skype for Business. By analysing your business requirements now and into the future we will provide you with the best solution.
